# zengarden-emscripten-demo

In 2016 I forked an implementation of the [Pure Data](https://puredata.info/) music programming language called ZenGarden
to get it to compile with Emscripten. The remnants of this effort are here: https://github.com/jacobstern/ZenGarden/. The demo uses this library to present a small Pure Data patch in the browser.
